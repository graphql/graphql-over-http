# Interested Developers

## Want to get involved?

If you're interested in this spec and helping contribute to it, you can get
involved with the following steps:

1. Read the [Roadmap](ROADMAP.md) which outlines the planned development of this
   spec.
2. See [Agendas](working-group/agendas) for upcoming meetings of the
   GraphQL-over-HTTP working group. Given our world-wide span over many
   timezones, we are doing an experiment of attempting to advance the spec with
   fewer meetings and more asynchronous communication. During this experiment,
   please reach out over Discord and GitHub.
3. Add yourself to `List of Developers` below.
4. Find our working group on the
   [GraphQL Foundation Discord community](https://discord.graphql.org) in the
   #graphql-over-http channel.
