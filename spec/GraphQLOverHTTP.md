# GraphQL over HTTP

**Introduction**

HTTP is the most common choice as the client-server protocol when using GraphQL because of its ubiquity.
However the [GraphQL specification](https://graphql.github.io/graphql-spec/) deliberately does not specify the transport layer.

The closest thing to an official specification is the article [Serving over HTTP](https://graphql.org/learn/serving-over-http/).
Leading implementations on both client and server have mostly upheld those best practices and thus established
a de-facto standard that is commonly used throughout the ecosystem.

This specification is intended to fill this gap by specifying how GraphQL should be served over HTTP.
The main intention of this specification is to provide interoperability between different client libraries, tools
and server implementations.

**Conformance**

A conforming implementation of GraphQL over HTTP must fulfill all normative requirements.
Conformance requirements are described in this document via both
descriptive assertions and key words with clearly defined meanings.

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in the normative portions of
this document are to be interpreted as described in [IETF RFC 2119](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119).
These key words may appear in lowercase and still retain their meaning unless
explicitly declared as non-normative.

A conforming implementation of GraphQL over HTTP may provide additional functionality,
but must not where explicitly disallowed or it would otherwise result
in non-conformance.

**Non-Normative Portions**

All contents of this document are normative except portions explicitly
declared as non-normative.

Examples in this document are non-normative, and are presented to aid
understanding of introduced concepts and the behavior of normative portions of
the specification. Examples are either introduced explicitly in prose
(e.g. "for example") or are set apart in example or counter-example blocks,
like this:

```example
This is an example of a non-normative example.
```

```counter-example
This is an example of a non-normative counter-example.
```

Notes in this document are non-normative, and are presented to clarify intent,
draw attention to potential edge-cases and pit-falls, and answer common
questions that arise during implementation. Notes are either introduced
explicitly in prose (e.g. "Note: ") or are set apart in a note block, like this:

Note: This is an example of a non-normative note.

# Overview

Serving GraphQL over HTTP provides the ability to use the full advantages of GraphQL with the rich feature set of HTTP.
Carrying GraphQL in HTTP does not mean that GraphQL overrides existing semantics of HTTP,
but rather that the semantics of GraphQL over HTTP map naturally to HTTP semantics.

GraphQL naturally follows the HTTP request/response message model,
providing a GraphQL request in an HTTP request and GraphQL response in an HTTP response.

# URL

A GraphQL over HTTP compliant server MUST designate at least one URL that handles GraphQL requests.

A GraphQL schema allows clients to know the available operations on a GraphQL server.
Clients can discover the schema by sending an introspection query, which the server MUST answer with a proper response. 

The schema on a single URL MAY not be the same for every client.
For example, certain fields could be restricted to authenticated users or alpha testers.

All Queries and Mutations a client discovered in the schema MUST be available on the same URL.
That means the client can send all their GraphQL requests to a single endpoint.

Multiple URLs MAY exist on a server to handle GraphQL requests, potentially serving different
but self-sufficient schemas. The same GraphQL schema MAY be available on multiple URLs on the server.

Those URLs MAY also be used for other purposes, as long as they don't conflict with the
server's responsibility to handle GraphQL requests.

It is RECOMMENDED to end the path component of the URL with `/graphql`, for example:

```url example
http://example.com/graphql
```

```url example
http://product.example.com/graphql
```

```url example
http://example.com/product/graphql
```

# Serialization Format

The GraphQL specification allows for many [serialization formats to be implemented](https://spec.graphql.org/June2018/#sec-Serialization-Format). Servers and clients over HTTP MUST support JSON and MAY support other, additional serialization formats.

For consistency and ease of notation, examples of the response are given in JSON throughout the spec.

## Content Types

The following are the officially recognized GraphQL content types to designate encoding JSON over HTTP.

| Name  | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| `application/graphql+json` | Required |
| `application/json` | To support legacy clients |

A server MUST support requests from clients with HTTP header `Content-Type: application/graphql+json` indicating that the body of the request is a JSON document with a GraphQL request. A server must indicate the content type of the response with a `Content-Type` header. This default value should be `Content-Type: application/graphql+json` indicating that the response is a valid JSON document [conforming to the GraphQL spec](http://spec.graphql.org/June2018/#sec-Response-Format).

A server MAY support requests from clients with other content types.

A client MUST handle receiving responses with HTTP header `Content-Type: application/graphql+json` since any compliant server must support this type.

This header MAY include encoding information (e.g. `Content-Type: application/graphql+json; charset=utf-8`)

# Request

A server MUST accept POST requests, and MAY accept other HTTP methods, such as GET.

## Request Parameters

A request for execution should contain the following request parameters:

* {query} - A Document containing GraphQL Operations and Fragments to execute.
* {operationName} - (*Optional*): The name of the Operation in the Document to execute.
* {variables} - (*Optional*): Values for any Variables defined by the Operation.
* {extensions} - (*Optional*): This entry is reserved for implementors to extend the protocol however they see fit.

Note: Be aware that `query` is a misleading name as it can contain a string describing multiple operations, each of which may be a query, mutation or subscription. A better name would have been `document`, but the term `query` is well established.

Note: depending on the serialization format used, values of the aforementioned parameters can be
encoded differently but their names and semantics must stay the same.

Note: specifying `null` in JSON (or equivalent values in other formats) as values for optional request parameters is equivalent to not specifying them at all.

Note: {variables} and {extensions}, if set, must have a map as its value.

## GET

For HTTP GET requests, the query parameters MUST be provided in the query component of the request URL in the form of
`key=value` pairs with `&` symbol as a separator and both the key and value should have their "reserved" characters percent-encoded as specified in [section 2 of RFC3986](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-2).
The `variables` parameter, if used, MUST be represented as a URL-encoded JSON string.

### Example

If we wanted to execute the following GraphQL query:

```graphql example
query ($id: ID!) {
  user(id:$id) {
    name
  }
}
```

With the following query variables:

```json example
{
  "id" : "QVBJcy5ndXJ1"
}
```

This request could be sent via an HTTP GET as follows:

```url example
http://example.com/graphql?query=query(%24id%3A%20ID!)%7Buser(id%3A%24id)%7Bname%7D%7D&variables=%7B%22id%22%3A%22QVBJcy5ndXJ1%22%7D
```

Note: {query} and {operationName} parameters are encoded as raw strings in the query component. Therefore if the query string contained `operationName=null` then it should be interpreted as the {operationName} being the string `"null"`. If a literal `null` is desired, the parameter (e.g. {operationName}) should be omitted.

GET requests MUST NOT be used for executing mutation operations. If the values of {query} and {operationName} indicate that a mutation operation is to be executed, the server SHOULD immediately respond with error status code `405` (Method Not Allowed) and halt execution. This restriction is necessary to conform with the long-established semantics of safe methods within HTTP.


## POST

A GraphQL POST request instructs the server to perform a query, mutation or subscription operation. A GraphQL POST request MUST have a body which contains values of the request parameters encoded according to the value of `Content-Type` header of the request.

A client MUST include a `Content-Type` with a POST request.

### Example

Given a POST request with a content type of `application/graphql+json` here is an example request body:

```json example
{
  "query": "query($id: ID!){user(id:$id){name}}",
  "variables": { "id": "QVBJcy5ndXJ1" }
}
```

# Response

When a GraphQL server receives a request, it must return a well‚Äêformed response. The server's
response describes the result of executing the requested operation if successful, and describes
any errors encountered during the request.

## Body

If the server's response contains a body it should follow the requirements for [GraphQL response](https://graphql.github.io/graphql-spec/June2018/#sec-Response).

A server MUST return a `Content-Type` HTTP Header with a value of a valid GraphQL content type. If there is no `Accept` header in the request, the response MUST be serialized as JSON and MUST include a  `Content-Type: application/graphql+json` header.

If another content type is preferable to a client, it MAY include an `Accept` HTTP header listing other acceptable content types in order of preference. In this case a client SHOULD include `application/graphql+json` in the list, according to their preferred priority.

The server MUST respect the given `Accept` header and attempt to encode the respond in the first supported content type listed. According to the [HTTP 1.1 Accept](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-5.3.2) specification, when a client does not include at least one supported content type in the `Accept` HTTP header, the server MAY choose to respond in one of several ways. The server MUST either:

1. Disregard the `Accept` header and respond with the default content type of `application/graphql+json`, specifying this in the `Content-Type` header; OR
2. Respond with a `406 Not Acceptable` status code

Note: For any non-`2XX` response, the client should not rely on the body to be in GraphQL format since the source of the response
may not be the GraphQL server but instead some intermediary such as API gateways, firewalls, etc.

## Status Codes

If the response has Content-Type GraphQL and contains a non-null `data` entry,
then it MUST have status code `2xx`, and it SHOULD have status code `200` (Okay).

If the response has Content-Type GraphQL and has a non-`2xx` status code,
the `data` entry must be either:
- equal to `null`
- not present

Note: The result of executing a GraphQL operation may contain partial data as well as encountered errors.
Errors that happen during execution of the GraphQL operation typically become part of the result,
as long as the server is still able to produce a well-formed response.

In case of errors that completely prevent the successful execution of the request,
the server SHOULD respond with the appropriate status code depending on the concrete error condition.

The following examples provide guidance on how to deal with specific error cases:

### Unparseable or invalid request body

For example: `NONSENSE`, `{"qeury": "{__typena`

Completely prevents execution of the GraphQL operation and SHOULD result in status code `400` (Bad Request).

### Document validation

Includes validation steps that run before execution of the GraphQL operation:
- [GraphQL specification validation](http://spec.graphql.org/June2018/#sec-Validation)
- custom validation, for example: depth limit, complexity limit

The server SHOULD deny execution with a status code of `400` (Bad Request).

Note: In certain circumstances, for example persisted queries that were previously
known to be valid, the server MAY attempt execution regardless of validation errors.

### Runtime validation

Validation steps performed by resolvers during execution of the GraphQL operation.

The server SHOULD respond with a status code of `200` (Okay) to ensure clients receive
a predictable result, no matter which fields they selected.

### Client is not allowed to access the schema

In case the client can not access the schema at all, the server SHOULD respond
with the appropriate `4xx` status code.
