- [https://github.com/graphql/graphql-over-http/issues/196](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-over-http/issues/196)
  - It is happening

## Test Suite

- Browser Testing vs. CLI
  - Benjie: Browsers can not make any kind of request, which would limit
    capabilities
- Technology
  - JavaScript
  - Get inspired by
    [https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-federation-subgraph-compatibility](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-federation-subgraph-compatibility)
  - As few dependencies and as simple as possible
- Errors for MUST, warnings for SHOULD
- Host in a separate repository under the GitHub graphql organization

## Remaining steps for advancing this spec

- Michael: 2 implementations (one JS) that include all the MUST _and_ the SHOULD
  behaviors.
- Everyone read it again.
- Denis: I can build graphql-http based solely on the spec.
- Benjie: then we can spot any omissions.
- David: using express-graphql would be potentially better because it has a
  larger user base.
- Denis: whilst building it I'd also be building out a test suite, maybe that
  can be reusable.
- Benedikt: I might do this for GraphQL PHP also.
