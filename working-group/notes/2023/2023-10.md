## Agenda

- Accept header with unsupported formats
- Persisted Operations
- Advancing GraphQL over HTTP to stage 2

## Accept header PR

Linking back to the HTTP specification, either respond with non-acceptable when
we can’t serve the format in the Accept header (recommended), not recommended
would be to answer in an unaccepted format.

- PR from Benjie
  [https://github.com/graphql/graphql-over-http/pull/227](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-over-http/pull/227)

General approval, no reservations - will merge.

## Persisted Operations RFC

Common pattern in Facebook since before GraphQL was open-sourced, this was used
to enhance security so only recognised operations can be executed. Worth calling
out that currently there is no specification for persisted operations, hash it
and send it to the server is the current state.

- RFC from Jovi
  [https://github.com/graphql/graphql-over-http/blob/main/rfcs/PersistedOperations.md](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-over-http/blob/main/rfcs/PersistedOperations.md)
- RFC w/ Appendix from Benjie
  [https://github.com/graphql/graphql-over-http/pull/264](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-over-http/pull/264)

APQ can be extended on top of the RFC’s but there’s some missing pieces as we
wouldn’t want to encourage using the extensions object for that as these are
free from the spec.

Relay would be compatible as it has its own network layer, chosen not to advance
this RFC this close to advancing the HTTP spec.

Coupling back to the current spec, `query` is mandatory, so from a compatibility
point persisted documents wouldn’t be compliant? It’s modeled differently,
optional to implement and it’s a translation to a query.

## Advancing the spec

Denis: been testing a lot of implementations, some are behind but shouldn’t be
too much effort to get them in line.

→ advancing the GraphQL Over HTTP spec to stage 2

Everyone is already treating this as a stage 2 spec, actually going to stage 3
will involve some legal work, getting signatures from contributors, … Help from
the Linux Foundation would happen here. TSC will vote before releasing the 1.0
version.

**Action item**: Benjie will create a pull request and leave it open for a few
weeks so folks can express any concerns.

**Action item**: Benjie to add a 3 minute agenda item to the core WG meeting
