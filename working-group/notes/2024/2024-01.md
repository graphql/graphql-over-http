## [Other keys are reserved](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-over-http/pull/278) (10m, Benjie)

- We want to explicitly reserve the keys, extensions are meant for extending the
  keys. We reserve the top-level shape (query, variables, extensions,
  operationName). The paragraph needs to clarify this
- It has been open for a while no-one has raised concerns

## [Advancing the spec to stage 2](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-over-http/pull/275) (5m, Benjie)

- Has been approved by the main wg
- :tada: merged the pull request effectively putting us at stage 2

## [Adding a section on security concerns](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-over-http/issues/280) (30m, Benjie)

- We don’t need to re-iterate all the HTTP security concerns as they are covered
  in different places
- However we shouldn’t ignore this, especially for GraphQL pitfalls
  - Example: particular media-types bypass CORS
- Inquiring with David Griesser and Stellate for Security concerns
- Generic HTTP security concerns
- **ACTION** - Jovi: reach out to Apollo regarding Persisted operations
