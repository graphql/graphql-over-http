The group discussed the removal of the watershed from the GraphQL over HTTP specification and the introduction of a new HTTP status code for partial success in GraphQL responses. They also planned to review and merge pull requests, including one about partial success, and aimed for a coupled release with the GraphQL spec in July. The group agreed to triage other open pull requests and issues, and planned to meet again in a month to push the project forward.

## Next Steps

- Benjie to merge the pull request for removing the watershed in one month's time.
- Benjie to add the partial success response code to the spec and raise a pull request.
- Benjie to review and merge the pull request for adding security to the spec.
- Benjie to update the spec to link to the extensions property in the GraphQL spec.
- Benjie to triage open pull requests and issues.

## Summary

### Removing Watershed From GraphQL Specification

Benjie, Martin, and Shane discuss the removal of the watershed from the GraphQL over HTTP specification. They agree to merge the pull request that removes the watershed, as there has been little adoption of the new header in the community. Benjie plans to review the changes for consistency and merge the pull request the following Thursday. The group also briefly touches on the need to move faster with the specification process.

### Introducing Partial Success HTTP Status Code

Benjie proposes introducing a new HTTP status code for partial success in GraphQL responses. The suggested code is in the 290s range, possibly 294. This would indicate that while the request was successful overall, some errors occurred. The status code would be useful for logging, proxies, intrusion detection systems, and monitoring tools, but not necessarily for clients. Shane and Martin agree it could be beneficial for tooling and logging purposes. The group decides to add it as a "should" recommendation rather than a "must" requirement in the specification. They also discuss the rationale behind mandating 2xx status codes for successful responses, citing client compatibility and interoperability with existing tools and practices. The security-related pull request has not yet been merged.

### GraphQL Spec and Pull Requests

Benjie plans to review and merge two pull requests on Thursday, including one about partial success. Martin suggests aiming for a coupled release with the GraphQL spec in July. The group discusses updating the extensions property, which is now defined in the GraphQL spec. They agree to triage other open pull requests and issues, and plan to meet again in a month to push the project forward.
