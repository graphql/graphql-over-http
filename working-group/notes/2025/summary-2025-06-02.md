Benjie and Martin discussed the status of a release, focusing on persistent queries, partial status codes, and URL structures. They made decisions on status codes and version numbers for the specification, aiming to release it before GraphQLConf with a spec freeze on July 1st. The pair also addressed the use of a new media type and agreed to postpone certain features for future releases, with Benjie planning to make final edits to the document.

## Next Steps

- Benjie to update the pull request (PR 203) to use status code 294 instead of 203 for partial responses.
- Martin to post a summary of the discussion about status codes in the pull request discussion.
- Benjie to review and update the text around the advice for using status code 294 in the specification.
- Benjie to finalize the persisted queries specification after the main 1.0 spec release.
- GraphQL Working Group to consider including guidance on incremental delivery and subscriptions in the next version of the specification.

## Summary

### Release Status and Status Code Discussion

Benjie and Martin discussed the status of the release, focusing on persistent queries and the partial status code. Benjie mentioned that persistent queries would come after the 1.0 release and that he wanted to make some final changes regarding URLs. They discussed the decision between different status codes, with Benjie noting that Dennis had tested and found that all browsers were compatible with the proposed codes. Benjie expressed a preference for using 2xx or 5xx codes, though he wasn't sure if the wording in the proposal was "must" or "should."

### Status Code Selection for Specification

Benjie and Martin discussed the choice of status codes for a specification, ultimately deciding to use 2,9,4 as it was the least likely to break things, though they acknowledged it might cause issues with intermediaries. They agreed to release the specification with this choice and monitor for any problems, with the possibility of changing it later if necessary. The specification was planned to be released before GraphQLConf, with a spec freeze set for July 1st.

### Status Code Irrelevance in Media Responses

Benjie emphasized that the new media type should only be used when necessary and clients must ignore the status code when using it. He explained that clients can determine the status of the response from the data and errors in the JSON, making the status code irrelevant. Martin agreed that the non-normative note about processing responses was clear.

### Document Version and API Updates

Benjie and Martin discussed updates to a document, focusing on changes to version numbers and URL structures. They agreed to use "2.9.4" for partial API changes and "2.9.5" for partial success. They decided to release the document with the agreed-upon changes and postpone the inclusion of persistent queries and additional advice on delivery methods until after the initial release. Benjie planned to make further edits to the text and notify Martin via Discord.
